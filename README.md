INSTALLATION
============

You can either use packaging scripts, which are stored in `package/`
subdirectory, or compile and install everything manually. Note that Doxygen
documentation contains more comprehensive guide for building, packaging and
crosscompiling.

Minimal dependencies
--------------------

-   C++ compiler with good C++11 support. Compilers which are tested to have
    everything needed are **GCC** >= 4.7, **Clang** >= 3.1 and **MSVC** 2015.
    On Windows you can also use **MinGW-w64**. GCC 4.6, 4.5, 4.4 and MSVC 2013
    support involves some ugly workarounds and thus is available only in
    `compatibility` branch.
-   **CMake** >= 2.8.12

Note that full feature set is available only on GCC >= 4.8.1 and Clang >= 3.1
and compatibility mode with reduced feature set must be enabled for other
compilers.

Compilation, installation
-------------------------

The library can be built and installed using these four commands:

    mkdir -p build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr .. && make
    make install

Building and running unit tests
-------------------------------

If you want to build also unit tests (which are not built by default), pass
`-DBUILD_TESTS=ON` to CMake. Unit tests use Corrade's own TestSuite framework
and can be run using

    ctest --output-on-failure

in build directory. Everything should pass ;-)

Building documentation
----------------------

The documentation is written in **Doxygen** (preferrably 1.8 with Markdown
support, but older versions should do good job too) and additionally uses
**Graphviz** for class diagrams. The documentation can be build by running

    doxygen

in root directory (i.e. where `Doxyfile` is). Resulting HTML documentation
will be in `build/doc/` directory.

Building examples
-----------------

The library comes with handful of examples, contained in `examples/`
directory. Each example is thoroughly explained in documentation. The examples
require Corrade to be installed and they are built separately:

    mkdir -p build-examples
    cd build-examples
    cmake ../examples
    make
